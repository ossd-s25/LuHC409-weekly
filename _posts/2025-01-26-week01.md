Before this class, I didn’t know what open source meant. I had never been exposed to it, nor did I understand its significance in the world of technology and collaboration. However, after attending lectures and exploring various resources, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of its essence.

Open source is not just about sharing code; it’s about fostering transparency, collaboration, and innovation. It allows developers worldwide to contribute their expertise, learn from one another, and collectively solve problems. The idea of working together openly, without the limitations of proprietary systems, is what makes open source so powerful.

Through this journey of learning, I’ve come to appreciate how open source has shaped the tech industry. Projects like Python, Firefox, and even large-scale AI initiatives such as DeepSeek demonstrate the immense impact that open-source collaboration can have. It’s inspiring to see how collective efforts can transform small ideas into world-changing innovations, and I’m eager to become part of this movement.


### Open Source vs. Closed Source  

Open source embodies progress and collaboration. By making source code accessible, it enables developers worldwide to inspect, modify, and improve software collectively. This openness fosters rapid innovation and the development of groundbreaking technologies. For instance, projects like DeepSeek have leveraged the power of open-source contributions to evolve from a small company into a world-class leader in large language models.

However, open source also has its challenges. The lack of stable funding can make it difficult to maintain projects over the long term. Open-source initiatives may struggle with sustainability and sometimes face security risks, such as vulnerabilities or malicious contributions.

Despite these challenges, open source is essential for technological progress. It breaks down barriers, encourages knowledge sharing, and accelerates advancements in ways that closed systems cannot. The success of DeepSeek is a testament to how open-source collaboration can drive innovation and turn ambitious ideas into global achievements.


### Why I Chose This Course  
I decided to enroll in the open-source software development course because I want to understand how open-source communities operate and how collaborative projects are managed. This course provides an opportunity to learn industry-relevant tools and practices, laying a strong foundation for my future career.

### Four Open Source Projects I Appreciate  
1. **Linux**  
   Linux serves as the foundation for modern computing. Its open-source nature has enabled the growth of various distributions. The flexibility and stability of Linux-based systems have been invaluable to me.

2. **Git**  
   Git, a distributed version control system, is an indispensable tool in modern software development. It has taught me how to manage code effectively and the importance of team collaboration.

3. **VS Code**  
   Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code is an open-source code editor I use daily. Its powerful plugin ecosystem and community support enhance the development experience significantly.

4. **Wikipedia**  
   While not a code-based project, Wikipedia is a vital resource for my learning. Its open-source model allows users worldwide to contribute content, fostering an inclusive knowledge platform.

These projects have shown me the profound impact of open source, not just in advancing technology but in promoting a culture of openness and cooperation. Through this course, I aim to contribute to the community and spread the spirit of open source.
