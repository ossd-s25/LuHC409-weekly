# Open Source in Public Service and Healthcare

This week’s class discussion and videos were eye-opening in many ways, particularly regarding the role of open-source technology in public service and healthcare. Before watching these videos, I primarily viewed coding as a means to build products, solve technical problems, and, admittedly, make money. However, the content we explored shifted my perspective, demonstrating how open-source initiatives can directly impact lives, especially in critical areas like healthcare and humanitarian aid.

## Diabetes and Open-Source Innovation

One of the most striking points was the struggle of diabetes patients in advocating for access to their own health data. The historical resistance from clinicians who believed patients should not have direct access to their blood sugar levels was shocking. It reminded me of how gatekeeping in technology and medical fields can hinder progress. The emergence of **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)** and platforms like **Nightscout**, developed by parents and patients themselves, highlighted the power of open-source communities in filling gaps left by proprietary solutions. The fact that CGM alarms weren’t initially customizable, causing alarm fatigue, and that companies delayed solutions for years, underscores the necessity of user-driven innovation.

The **OpenAPS project** was another standout. It started as a personal solution for an individual who needed better control over their diabetes management and grew into a broader movement that now allows automated insulin regulation. The collaboration between individuals, communities, and open-source developers turned what was once a risky and manual process into a more accessible, reliable system.

## Open Insulin Project and Pharmaceutical Accessibility

The discussion around the **Open Insulin Project** also challenged my perception of pharmaceutical accessibility. The cost of insulin in the U.S. is alarmingly high, forcing many diabetics to ration their medication, which can lead to life-threatening consequences. Seeing a community-driven initiative aimed at producing **open-source insulin**, ensuring affordability and availability, made me realize the untapped potential of software and biotechnology in making essential medicines more accessible.

## Open-Source in Humanitarian Efforts

The broader theme of open-source in public service, as discussed in the videos on **humanitarian free and open-source software (HFOSS)**, reinforced this idea. Whether it's in disaster response, crisis mapping, or medical aid, open-source technology provides solutions that are flexible, adaptable, and accessible to everyone. The example of **OpenStreetMap** in humanitarian crises stood out as a clear demonstration of how crowd-sourced data can save lives.

## My Perspective as a Computer Scientist

Reflecting on all of this, I see a new role for myself as a computer scientist beyond conventional development work. Open-source projects offer an opportunity to contribute to meaningful causes while still leveraging technical skills. Instead of solely focusing on profit-driven software development, there’s a path where coding can be used for social good, whether through developing accessible medical software, creating platforms for real-time crisis response, or even contributing to projects that promote educational equity like **OpenStax**.

## Conclusion

This week’s materials reshaped my understanding of what technology can achieve. While financial stability remains important, the impact of open-source contributions in healthcare, crisis management, and public access to knowledge is undeniable. As I continue in this field, I hope to explore ways to integrate my technical skills into open-source projects that contribute to broader societal benefits, ensuring that technology serves not just corporations, but people who truly need it.
