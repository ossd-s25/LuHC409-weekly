# **Code of Conduct in Open Source Communities: A Cultural Guide Beyond Rules**

In open source communities, a Code of Conduct (CoC) is more than just a set of rules‚Äîit is a reflection of the community's culture. It establishes fundamental ethical and behavioral expectations, ensuring that all participants can collaborate in a friendly and inclusive environment. A well-structured CoC improves communication efficiency among community members, strengthens teamwork, and enhances the community‚Äôs overall reputation, attracting more contributors and users.

## **Go Language‚Äôs Code of Conduct: An Optimization of Contributor Covenant**

Take the Go language's Code of Conduct [üîó Go CoC](https://go.dev/conduct) as an example. This CoC builds upon the Contributor Covenant with significant optimizations in two key areas:

### **1. Improved Conflict Resolution Approach**

The Go CoC replaces the term ‚ÄúEnforcement‚Äù in Contributor Covenant with ‚ÄúConflict Resolution.‚Äù While ‚Äúenforcement‚Äù implies mandatory and punitive actions, ‚Äúconflict resolution‚Äù emphasizes negotiation and dialogue.

This adjustment highlights the Go community‚Äôs commitment to an open and friendly environment, aiming to resolve conflicts through communication and mediation rather than punitive measures. Additionally, the Go CoC details the process of handling violations, including preliminary investigations, discussions with involved parties, and possible corrective actions, rather than focusing solely on punishment.

### **2. Expanded Scope**

While the Contributor Covenant primarily applies within project spaces, the Go CoC extends its applicability beyond projects, including social media interactions and open-source conferences. This broader scope ensures the overall health and consistency of the Go community‚Äôs culture.

## **Eclipse Project‚Äôs Code of Conduct: Differences in Accountability and Handling**

Another case of a Contributor Covenant-based CoC is the Eclipse Foundation‚Äôs [üîó Eclipse CoC](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php). Compared to the Go project, Eclipse differs in terms of accountability and enforcement mechanisms.

### **1. Accountability**

- **Eclipse Foundation**: The ‚ÄúEclipse Behavior Committee‚Äù is responsible for oversight and enforcement, supported by employees, advisors, administrators, and board members.
- **Go Project**: Project maintainers are responsible for setting and enforcing behavior standards.

Eclipse follows a formal committee-based approach to oversee multiple projects, while Go, as a single open-source project, delegates responsibility to its maintainers.

### **2. Handling Mechanisms**

- **Eclipse**: The CoC does not specify detailed handling mechanisms for misconduct but states that the Behavior Committee will take ‚Äúappropriate and fair corrective measures,‚Äù leaving considerable discretion.
- **Go**: Specifies actions that project maintainers may take, such as deleting non-compliant comments, commits, or code, and temporarily or permanently banning contributors.

Eclipse adopts a more formal management system, whereas Go empowers maintainers for quicker responses to violations.

## **Non-Contributor Covenant Codes of Conduct: From Specific Guidelines to Abstract Values**

Different open-source communities adopt varying approaches to CoC creation:

- **Sugar Labs** provides **specific and actionable guidelines**, such as ‚ÄúBe Flexible‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen you disagree, consult others.‚Äù
- **Ubuntu** emphasizes **high-level values**, such as ‚ÄúValue decisiveness, clarity, and consensus‚Äù and ‚ÄúLeadership, authority, and responsibility.‚Äù

Sugar Labs' guidelines are practical and suitable for non-technical users such as children and educators. In contrast, Ubuntu focuses on community culture and governance, aligning more with technical contributors and open-source participants.

## **Python Community‚Äôs Code of Conduct: Stricter Restrictions and Formal Enforcement**

Python, as a large global open-source project, has a CoC [üîó Python CoC](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/) that differs from the Contributor Covenant, Ubuntu, and Sugar Labs‚Äô guidelines in several ways:

### **1. Explicit Restrictions on Violent Behavior**

Python‚Äôs CoC explicitly prohibits inciting violence, including:

> ‚ÄúInciting violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.‚Äù

In contrast, the Contributor Covenant, Ubuntu, and Sugar Labs CoCs emphasize respect and inclusivity but do not explicitly address violence. Python‚Äôs stricter stance likely stems from its large community size and the need to prevent cyberbullying and harassment.

### **2. Inclusion of a ‚ÄúWeapons Policy‚Äù**

Python‚Äôs CoC specifically restricts weapons-related discussions:

> ‚ÄúViolence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.‚Äù

Neither the Contributor Covenant nor Ubuntu/Sugar Labs CoCs explicitly mention weapons. Python‚Äôs inclusion of such a clause reflects a proactive approach to ensuring safety within a global technical community.

### **3. Formal Violation Handling Mechanism**

Python has established a **Python Community Conduct Workgroup** to handle CoC violations:

> ‚ÄúThe Python Community Conduct WG will receive and evaluate reports of conduct violations.‚Äù

While the Contributor Covenant assigns enforcement to community maintainers, Python employs a structured governance model to ensure greater authority and consistency in CoC enforcement.
