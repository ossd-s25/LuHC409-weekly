# **Code of Conduct in Open Source Communities: A Cultural Guide Beyond Rules**

In open source communities, a Code of Conduct (CoC) is more than just a set of rules—it is a reflection of the community's culture. It establishes fundamental ethical and behavioral expectations, ensuring that all participants can collaborate in a friendly and inclusive environment. A well-structured CoC improves communication efficiency among community members, strengthens teamwork, and enhances the community’s overall reputation, attracting more contributors and users.

## **Go Language’s Code of Conduct: An Optimization of Contributor Covenant**

In analyzing the Go language's Code of Conduct [🔗 Go CoC](https://go.dev/conduct), it is evident that it incorporates deeper modifications to the Contributor Covenant in two key areas:
<!--more-->
### **1. Improved Conflict Resolution Approach**

The Go CoC replaces the term “Enforcement” in the Contributor Covenant with “Conflict Resolution.” Unlike “enforcement,” which implies compulsion and punitive actions, “conflict resolution” emphasizes the possibility of negotiation and dialogue.

This change reflects the Go community’s emphasis on an open and friendly environment, aiming to resolve conflicts through effective communication and mediation rather than punitive measures. This aligns with Go’s behavioral guidelines, known as “Gopher values,” which include kindness, patience, thoughtfulness, respect, tolerance, constructiveness, and responsibility.

Specifically, the Go CoC details the process of handling violations, including preliminary investigations, discussions with the involved parties, and potential corrective actions, rather than merely focusing on punishment.

### **2. Expanded Scope**

The Contributor Covenant primarily focuses on behavioral guidelines within project spaces. However, the Go CoC expands its applicability, stating that even if a member's behavior occurs outside the project environment, it still falls under the CoC if it could negatively impact the community.

This extension likely stems from Go’s intention to maintain the overall health of its community and ensure that members uphold a certain behavioral standard in various contexts. For example, the Go community expects its members to maintain community-aligned conduct on social media and at open-source conferences.

This modification also underscores the Go community’s long-term vision and brand image, ensuring that it is not merely a code collaboration space but a sustainable and trustworthy technological ecosystem.

## **Eclipse Project’s Code of Conduct: Differences in Accountability and Handling**

Another case of a Contributor Covenant-based CoC is the Eclipse Foundation’s [🔗 Eclipse CoC](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php). Compared to the Go project, Eclipse differs in terms of accountability and enforcement mechanisms.

### **1. Differences in Accountability**

#### **Eclipse Foundation**
In Eclipse’s Code of Conduct, oversight and enforcement are handled by the **Eclipse Behavior Committee**, supported by employees (including advisors, administrators, and board members), contributors, and project leaders. The Behavior Committee is responsible for defining acceptable behavior standards and ensuring fair and appropriate corrective actions for violations.

#### **Go Project**
In the Go project’s CoC, oversight and enforcement are primarily managed by **Project Maintainers**, who set behavior standards and take appropriate and fair measures against misconduct.

#### **Key Differences**
Eclipse follows a formal committee-based model for governance, reflecting its status as a large organization managing multiple projects. In contrast, Go, as a standalone open-source project, empowers maintainers to handle misconduct more directly.

### **2. Differences in Handling Mechanisms**

#### **Eclipse Foundation**
Eclipse’s CoC does not specify detailed enforcement mechanisms for the Behavior Committee. Instead, it broadly states that the committee will take “appropriate and fair corrective measures.” This approach allows for flexibility in handling different situations.

#### **Go Project**
Go’s CoC explicitly grants project maintainers specific enforcement powers, including:
- Removing, editing, or rejecting comments, commits, code contributions, wiki edits, and issues that violate the CoC.
- Temporarily or permanently banning contributors who engage in inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior.

#### **Key Differences**
Eclipse emphasizes high-level governance without detailing enforcement actions, giving its Behavior Committee broad discretion. In contrast, Go’s CoC grants direct enforcement authority to maintainers and clearly outlines potential actions, enabling quicker responses to misconduct. 

This distinction likely arises because:
- Eclipse requires a formal management structure for handling complex community interactions.
- Go’s project governance is more flexible, allowing maintainers to act swiftly to maintain order.

## **Non-Contributor Covenant Codes of Conduct: From Specific Guidelines to Abstract Values**

Different open-source communities adopt varying approaches to CoC creation:

- **Sugar Labs** provides **specific and actionable guidelines**, such as “Be Flexible” and “When you disagree, consult others.”
- **Ubuntu** emphasizes **high-level values**, such as “Value decisiveness, clarity, and consensus” and “Leadership, authority, and responsibility.”

Sugar Labs' guidelines are practical and suitable for non-technical users such as children and educators. In contrast, Ubuntu focuses on community culture and governance, aligning more with technical contributors and open-source participants.

## **Python Community’s Code of Conduct: Stricter Restrictions and Formal Enforcement**

Python, as a large global open-source project, has a CoC [🔗 Python CoC](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/) that differs from the Contributor Covenant, Ubuntu, and Sugar Labs’ guidelines in several ways:

### **1. Explicit Restrictions on Violent Behavior**

Python’s CoC explicitly prohibits inciting violence, including:

> “Inciting violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.”

In contrast, the Contributor Covenant, Ubuntu, and Sugar Labs CoCs emphasize respect and inclusivity but do not explicitly address violence. Python’s stricter stance likely stems from its large community size and the need to prevent cyberbullying and harassment.

### **2. Inclusion of a “Weapons Policy”**

Python’s CoC specifically restricts weapons-related discussions:

> “Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.”

Neither the Contributor Covenant nor Ubuntu/Sugar Labs CoCs explicitly mention weapons. Python’s inclusion of such a clause reflects a proactive approach to ensuring safety within a global technical community.

### **3. Formal Violation Handling Mechanism**

Python has established a **Python Community Conduct Workgroup** to handle CoC violations:

> “The Python Community Conduct WG will receive and evaluate reports of conduct violations.”

While the Contributor Covenant assigns enforcement to community maintainers, Python employs a structured governance model to ensure greater authority and consistency in CoC enforcement.
