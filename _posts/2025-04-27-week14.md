# Week 14 | Presentations

This week was really exciting because we had two project presentations lined up ‚Äî one from our classmates on Preswald, and one from our team on Huggingface.

## Preswald Presentation

Our classmates introduced **Preswald**, a lightweight framework for building data-visualization dashboards using Python and HTML. Rather than open-sourcing every feature, Preswald follows an **Open Core** model: the core library is free and extensible, but advanced widgets and enterprise integrations require a paid license.

**Key takeaways from their demo:**
- **Community health**  
  - A small but active subreddit keeps conversation going.  
  - The official Slack channel exists, but it‚Äôs under-moderated and often slow to respond.  
- **Core contributions**  
  1. LaTeX support ‚Äì rendering math in charts  
  2. Sidebar functionality ‚Äì handling tokenized menu items proved tricky  
  3. Interactive chat interface ‚Äì built against their published docs  
  4. Debug panel ‚Äì streamlined development and visual testing  

They were candid about the hurdles they encountered:
- Sparse documentation made onboarding the codebase a steep climb.  
- Rapid churn in upstream releases frequently broke their local branches.  
- Community support was uneven, leaving some PRs in limbo.  

> **Tip:** Schedule quick sync-calls with Preswald maintainers and advocate for a formal **Contributing Guide** to smooth the initial setup process.

## Huggingface Presentation

Our team‚Äôs presentation covered our final OSSD project on **Huggingface** ü§ó ‚Äî one of the largest open-source AI ecosystems. We structured our talk into five parts:

**1. What Is Huggingface?**  
Huggingface provides a unified hub for ML models, datasets, and tools.  
- **Transformers** (e.g., DeepSeek, Llama, Nemotron)  
- **Diffusers** (e.g., Stable Diffusion XL, ControlNet)  
- **Datasets** (e.g., Wikipedia, CommonsenseQA, COCO)  

**2. Contribution Statistics**  
- **Total contributions:** 22  
  - 11 PRs (4 merged)  
  - 11 issues  
- **Breakdown by category:**  
  - Feature Implementation ‚Äî 3  
  - Bug Fixes ‚Äî 3  
  - Bug Analysis ‚Äî 4  
  - Documentation Improvement ‚Äî 4  
  - Community Support ‚Äî 3  
  - Infrastructure Improvement ‚Äî 3  
  - Test Additions ‚Äî 2  

**3. Our Workflow**  
- **Slack coordination:** Clear channels for feature requests, reviews, and hotfixes  
- **Branch strategy:** Each contributor claimed an issue, created a feature branch, then pinged reviewers  
- **Pull-request etiquette:** Descriptive titles, linked issues, and inline code comments kept reviews efficient  

### Individual Contributions
- **Haocheng Lu:** Patched indexing logic, optimized attention masks, corrected padding in the image processor, fixed documentation links, and added configurable head dimensions for MoE models.  
- **Yufeng Xu:** Closed outdated bug branches, enforced type consistency, stabilized KV-cache parameters, and improved the installation guide.  
- **Haochen Yang:** Refactored complex code paths for clarity and reliability, and patched edge-case behaviors in the training loop.  
- **Minjun Zhu:** Enhanced documentation clarity, wrote comprehensive tests for cache updates and tensor-parallel features, added ‚Äúresume checkpoint‚Äù support in ClearML, and provided example code for fine-tuning SigLIP2.  

### Group Contribution: Time-Based Strategy
- **Motivation:** Step/epoch-based evaluation and saving can drift across different hardware environments.  
- **Process:**  
  1. Claimed the feature request for `eval_strategy=TIME`.  
  2. Iterated with maintainers on PR formatting and unit tests.  
  3. Verified through three test scenarios:  
     - **Evaluation trigger** (`eval_minutes=1`)  
     - **Checkpoint saving** (`save_minutes=1`)  
     - **Logging output** (`logging_minutes=1`)

## Final Thoughts

Comparing the two projects highlighted the spectrum of open-source engagement:
- **Preswald** is nimble and still carving out its ecosystem, but needs stronger documentation and community processes.  
- **Huggingface** boasts a mature infrastructure with clear contribution pathways, yet still relies on dedicated testers and communicators.

No matter the scale, impactful open-source work comes down to:
1. Deep codebase familiarity  
2. Transparent communication  
3. Rigorous testing  
4. Persistence through setbacks  

Really proud of everyone‚Äôs efforts this week! üéâ
