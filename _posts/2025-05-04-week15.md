## Team AutoGen

  By holding daily stand‑ups, adopting clear branch naming, and using PR templates, we minimized merge conflicts and accelerated review cycles.

  Debugging `app_agent.py` and architecting `app_group.py` deepened our understanding of multi‑agent AI frameworks, asynchronous messaging, and core Chainlit integration.  
- **Community Engagement**  
  Frequent, respectful communication with maintainers taught us to write concise issue reports, follow up efficiently, and iterate quickly on requested changes.

## Team Lucide
- **Design & Prototyping**  
  From sketching concepts to delivering production‑ready SVGs, we learned to navigate design guidelines, version non‑code assets, and maintain visual consistency.  
- **Code Review & Quality**  
  Multiple review rounds instilled best practices in naming conventions, modular CSS, and accessibility, raising our standards for readability and maintainability.  
- **Open‑Source Etiquette**  
  Proactive discussions before PR submissions, citing style guides, and attributing icon sources fostered goodwill and encouraged faster merges.

## Team Oppia
- **Internationalization**  
  Translating lessons into Spanish, Chinese, and Italian revealed the nuances of localization workflows, string management, and culturally appropriate phrasing.  
- **Content Creation**  
  Publishing two interactive community explorations honed our instructional design skills—storyboarding, skill‑tree mapping, and coordinating media assets.  
- **Cross‑Functional Collaboration**  
  Balancing translations, voice‑over auditions, and frontend fixes demonstrated the power of diverse skill sets working together to enhance a learning platform.

## Team Mattermost
- **Environment Orchestration**  
  Configuring web, mobile, and plugin repos with Docker and test users sharpened our DevOps abilities and cross‑platform debugging techniques.  
- **Incremental Value Delivery**  
  From fixing broken links to writing unit tests for `command.go`, we learned that well‑scoped, small contributions build credibility and momentum.  
- **CI/CD Integration**  
  Observing our changes trigger pipeline jobs instilled discipline in atomic commits, branch hygiene, and continuous integration best practices.

## Team The Odin Project
- **Rapid Onboarding**  
  Diving into Markdown curriculum files and site structure let us quickly spot typos, update resource links, and propose content improvements.  
- **Full‑Stack Perspective**  
  Tackling both curriculum updates and front‑end UI bugs (color contrast, Flexbox examples) gave us a holistic view of educational platform maintenance.  
- **Self‑Driven Initiative**  
  Even without explicit issues, we learned to propose small improvements—fixing typos, suggesting examples—reinforcing autonomy and proactive contribution.
